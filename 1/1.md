# Discussion 1

Today:
* Control Structures
  * Conditional Statements
  * Boolean Operators
  * (A review of my mini-presentation in lab)
* Environment Diagrams
  * Assignment
  * Call Diagrams
* Check-in: `go/addison-disc` (**use your Berkeley email**)
  * Magic word: chipotle

Announcements:
* HW01 is released. Due **9/2 (Thurs)**
* Hog is released.
  * Phase 1 **due 9/7 (Tues)**
  * Phase 2 **due 9/10 (Fri)**. *One bonus point for submitting 9/9 (Thurs).*
  * Would recommend finding a partner!

Miscellaneous:
* Come grab a worksheet + Hello Panda in the front.
* Fill out my feedback form, even if it's (only) positive feedback (tell me what I should start/stop doing!)

# Control Structures!

Refresher:

Conditional statements look like this:

```py
if <conditional expression>:
    <suite of statements>
elif <conditional expression>:
    <suite of statements>
else:
    <suite of statements>
```

Boolean operators look like this:
* `<condition> and <condition>`
* `<condition> or <condition>`
* `not <condition>`

Truthiness:
* Falsy values in Python are all "empty-like" values:
```py
False, None, 0, "", [], etc.
```
* Truthy values are everything else!

We can loop while some condition is true like this:
```py
while <conditional clause>:
    <statements body>
```

# Warmup: Q1 + Q2

Go ahead and try them! When you're done, discuss with your neighbor. Feel free to try solving Q1 in one line.

```py
def wears_jacket_with_if(temp, raining):
    """
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(90, False)
    False
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(40, False)
    True
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(100, True)
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

---

# Q1 Solution:

```py
def wears_jacket_with_if(temp, raining):
    """
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(90, False)
    False
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(40, False)
    True
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(100, True)
    True
    """
    return temp < 60 or raining
```

# Q2.1 Solution:

```py
def special_case():
    x = 10
    if x > 0:
        x += 2
    elif x < 13:
        x += 3
    elif x % 2 == 1:
        x += 4
    return x

special_case()
```

---

# Q2.2 Solution:

```py
def just_in_case():
    x = 10
    if x > 0:
        x += 2
    if x < 13:
        x += 3
    if x % 2 == 1:
        x += 4
    return x

just_in_case()
```

---

# Q2.3 Solution:

```py
def case_in_point():
    x = 10
    if x > 0:
        return x + 2
    if x < 13:
        return x + 3
    if x % 2 == 1:
        return x + 4
    return x

case_in_point()
```

# Q3: If Function vs Statement

Find a set of functions `cond, true_func, false_func` such that they give different results when run with `with_if_statement` and `with_if_function`.

(Fun fact! This used to be a homework problem.)

```py
def with_if_statement():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_statement()
    61A
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    if cond():
        return true_func()
    else:
        return false_func()

def with_if_function():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_function()
    Welcome to
    61A
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    return if_function(cond(), true_func(), false_func())

def cond():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def true_func():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def false_func():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

```

---

# Q3: If Function vs Statement

```py
def cond():
    return False

def true_func():
    print("Welcome to")

def false_func():
    print("61A")
```

# While Loop Warmup: Q4 + Q5

Work with people next to you!

What happens in this snippet of code?

```py
def square(x):
    print("here!")
    return x * x

def so_slow(num):
    x = num
    while x > 0:
        x=x+1
    return x / 0

square(so_slow(5))
```

Write a function that returns whether `n` is prime:
```py
def is_prime(n):
    """
    >>> is_prime(10)
    False
    >>> is_prime(7)
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# Q6: FIZZBUZZ

Implement the fizzbuzz sequence, which prints out a single statement for each number from 1 to `n`. For a number `i`,

* If `i` is divisible by 3 only, then we print "fizz".
* If `i` is divisible by 5 only, then we print "buzz".
* If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, then we print "fizzbuzz".
* Otherwise, we print the number `i` by itself.

```py
def fizzbuzz(n):
    """
    >>> result = fizzbuzz(16)
    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
    8
    fizz
    buzz
    11
    fizz
    13
    14
    fizzbuzz
    16
    >>> result == None
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# HOW ARE WE FEELING ?

# Environment Diagrams

Alright it's time for me to whiteboard -->

# Try Q8: Def Diagram

---

# Call Expressions

**This is important!**

When evaluating call expressions,
1. Evaluate the operator
2. Evaluate the operands, left to right
3. Apply the operator to the operands (for built-ins, we don't open a new frame.)
  1. Open a new frame
  2. Bind the formal parameters to the argument values
  3. Evaluate the function body

# Now try it with Q9!

---

# Q10!

---

# Break

---

# 2x Time

Poll:
1. Fun Python things
2. More environment diagrams (exam-preppy)
3. Sneak peek ahead at next week: `lambda` functions + higher-order functions (shows up on Hog).

# More Environment Diagrams: YY Diagram

```py
y = "y"
h = y
def y(y):
    h = "h"
    if y == h:
        return y + "i"
    y = lambda y: y(h)
    return lambda h: y(h)
y = y(y)(y)
```

# More Environment Diagrams: YesNo Diagram

```py
def yes(no):
    yes = "no"
    return no

no = "no"

def no(no):
    return no + yes(no)

yes = yes(yes)(no)("ok")
```
