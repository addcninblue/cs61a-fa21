        * ...

Announcements:
* Hog Contests are released (Optional).
  * Due 9/20 (Monday)
* Congratulations on finishing the midterm!

Miscellaneous:
* **Come grab a worksheet + snack bar in the front.**
* Fill out my feedback form, even if it's (only) positive feedback (tell me what I should start/stop doing!)
* My office hours: Thurs 5-6pm, in-person.

Go ahead and look at Q1 / get started if you'd like! I'll begin talking about recursion in a bit, but this will be good to wake you up :D.

# Recursion

A way of solving a big problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems **of the same nature**. (This means the *implementation* of the function is written *in terms of itself*.)

Example: `factorial`. Whiteboard -->

# Recursion, a 3-step guide

1. **Base case.** You can think of the base case as the case of the simplest function input, or as the stopping condition for the recursion.
2. **Recursive call on a smaller problem.** You can think of this step as calling the function on a smaller problem that our current problem depends on. We assume that a recursive call on this smaller problem will give us the expected result; we call this idea the "recursive leap of faith".
3. **Solve the larger problem.** In step 2, we found the result of a smaller problem. We want to now use that result to figure out what the result of our current problem should be, which is what we want to return from our current function call.

For those of you familiar, think **Induction**. (It's the exact same concept!)

        return x * rec(x, y - 1)
    return 1

rec(3, 2)

# Poll!

How do we feel about recursion? Do we want to continue doing worksheet problems, or do we want to tackle something harder?

# Q4: Is Prime

Write a function `is_prime` that takes a single argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Assume `n > 1`.

```py
def is_prime(n):
    """Returns True if n is a prime number and False otherwise.

    >>> is_prime(2)
    True
    >>> is_prime(16)
    False
    >>> is_prime(521)
    True
    """
```

    >>> is_prime(2)
    True
    >>> is_prime(16)
    False
    >>> is_prime(521)
    True
    """
    def helper(i):
        if i > (n ** 0.5): # Could replace with i == n
            return True
        elif n % i == 0:
            return False
        return helper(i + 1)
    return helper(2)

# Q5: Recursive Hailstone

Recall the `hailstone` function from Homework 1.
First, pick a positive integer `n` as the start. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until `n` is 1.
Write a recursive version of `hailstone` that prints out the values of the sequence and returns the number of steps.

```py
def hailstone(n):
    """Print out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and return the number of elements in the sequence.
    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

    >>> a = hailstone(10)

    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    """
    print(n)
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 1 + hailstone(n // 2)
    else:
        return 1 + hailstone(3 * n + 1)
```

# Q6: Merge Numbers

Write a procedure `merge(n1, n2)` which takes numbers with digits in decreasing
order and returns a single number with all of the digits of the two,
in decreasing order. Any number merged with 0 will be that number
(treat 0 as having no digits). Use recursion.

```py
def merge(n1, n2):
    """ Merges two numbers by digit in decreasing order
    >>> merge(31, 42)
    4321
    >>> merge(21, 0)
    21
    >>> merge (21, 31) 
    3211
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# Q6: Merge Numbers

```py
def merge(n1, n2):
    """ Merges two numbers by digit in decreasing order
    >>> merge(31, 42)
    4321
    >>> merge(21, 0)
    21
    >>> merge (21, 31) 
    3211
    """
    if n1 == 0:
        return n2
    elif n2 == 0:
        return n1
    elif n1 % 10 < n2 % 10:
        return merge(n1 // 10, n2) * 10 + n1 % 10
    else:
        return merge(n1, n2 // 10) * 10 + n2 % 10
```

# The 2x material begins...

Some interesting thoughts to consider:

1. What's the difference in output/environment diagram of the two snippets of code below? (Ignore the fact that they have different numbers of arguments.)
  ```py
  def multiply(m, n):
      """ Takes two positive integers and returns their product using recursion.
      >>> multiply(5, 3)
      15
      """
      if n == 0:
          return 0
      else:
          return m + multiply(m, n - 1)

  def multiply2(m, n, prod_so_far=0):
      """ Takes two positive integers and returns their product using recursion.
      >>> multiply2(5, 3)
      15
      """
      if n == 0:
        return prod_so_far
      else:
        return multiply2(m, n - 1, m + prod_so_far)
  ```
  Later material, but we call this **tail recursion**.
2. If you want, you can consider recursion as **walking a graph**.

# Towers of Hanoi (HW03, Q5)
Please load up homework to look at Towers of Hanoi. The visualization helps a lot.

```py
def print_move(origin, destination):
    """Print instructions to move a disk."""
    print("Move the top disk from rod", origin, "to rod", destination)

def move_stack(n, start, end):
    """Print the moves required to move n disks on the start pole to the end
    pole without violating the rules of Towers of Hanoi.

    n -- number of disks
    start -- a pole position, either 1, 2, or 3
    end -- a pole position, either 1, 2, or 3

    There are exactly three poles, and start and end must be different. Assume
    that the start pole has at least n disks of increasing size, and the end
    pole is either empty or has a top disk larger than the top n start disks.

    >>> move_stack(1, 1, 3)
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 3
    >>> move_stack(2, 1, 3)
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 2
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 3
    Move the top disk from rod 2 to rod 3
    >>> move_stack(3, 1, 3)
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 3
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 2
    Move the top disk from rod 3 to rod 2
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 3
    Move the top disk from rod 2 to rod 1
    Move the top disk from rod 2 to rod 3
    Move the top disk from rod 1 to rod 3
    """
    assert 1 <= start <= 3 and 1 <= end <= 3 and start != end, "Bad start/end"
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# Knapsack

*Note: We probably don't have time to cover this, but this is a theoretically-interesting question. If you go down CS, you'll find this problem again in CS170. This problem belongs to a set of problems that are called NP-Complete problems, which describes its runtime complexity.*

You are a thief, and your job is to pick among `n` items that are of
different weights and values. You have a knapsack that supports `c` pounds, and
you want to pick some subset of the items so that you maximize the value you've
stolen.

Define `knapsack`, which takes a list `weights`, list `values` and a capacity
`c`, and returns that max value.  You may assume that item 0 weighs
`weights[0]` pounds, and is worth `values[0]`; item 1 weighs `weights[1]`
pounds, and is worth `values[1]`; etc.

```py
def knapsack(weights, values, c):
    """
    >>> w = [2, 6, 3, 3]
    >>> v = [1, 5, 3, 3]
    >>> knapsack(w, v, 6)
    6
    """
    if weights == []:
        ___
    else:

```
