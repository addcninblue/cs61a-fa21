# Call Expressions (From last week)

**This is important!**

When evaluating call expressions,
1. Evaluate the operator
2. Evaluate the operands, left to right
3. Apply the operator to the operands (for built-ins, we don't open a new frame.)
  1. Open a new frame
  2. Bind the formal parameters to the argument values
  3. Evaluate the function body

# Lambda Functions

Syntax:
```py
lambda <arguments>: <body>
```

Nested lambda statements (special case of above):
```py
lambda <arguments>: lambda <arguments>: <body>
```

equivalent to

```py
lambda <arguments>: (lambda <arguments>: <body>)
```

so the first lambda statement is really just a lambda that returns another lambda, with this as the body:
```py
(lambda <arguments>: <body>)
```

Example on board ->

# Higher-order Functions

Definition: A **higher order function (HOF)** is a function that manipulates other functions by taking in functions as arguments, returning a function, or both.

```py
def composer(func1, func2):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = func1(func2(x))."""
    def f(x):
        return func1(func2(x))
    return f
```

or as you saw in lab, `curry`:

```py
def lambda_curry2(func):
    return lambda arg1: lambda arg2: func(arg1, arg2)
```

Why is this powerful?

```py
def composer(func1, func2):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = func1(func2(x))."""
    def f(x):
        return func1(func2(x))
    return f
```

or as you saw in lab, `curry`:

```py
def lambda_curry2(func):
    return lambda arg1: lambda arg2: func(arg1, arg2)
```

or as we commonly see, `add_n`:
```py
>>> def add_n(n):
...    return lambda x: x + n
...
>>> add_one = add_n(1)
>>> add_one(3)
4
```

Why is this powerful?
* It allows us to "remember data" -> "closure".

# Practice! Do Q1.

```py
def make_keeper(n):
    """Returns a function which takes one parameter cond and prints
    out all integers 1..i..n where calling cond(i) returns True.

    >>> def is_even(x):
    ...     # Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2.
    ...     return x % 2 == 0
    >>> make_keeper(5)(is_even)
    2
    4
    """
```

# Q1

```py
def make_keeper(n):
    """Returns a function which takes one parameter cond and prints
    out all integers 1..i..n where calling cond(i) returns True.

    >>> def is_even(x):
    ...     # Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2.
    ...     return x % 2 == 0
    >>> make_keeper(5)(is_even)
    2
    4
    """
    def do_keep(cond):
        i = 1
        while i <= n:
            if cond(i):
                print(i)
            i += 1
    return do_keep
```

# Self-Reference

A self-referential function is a higher-order function that simply returns itself (or something functionally similar to itself, like the `say` function in Hog).

Examples:
```py
def print_all(x):
    print(x)
    return print_all
```

```py
def print_sums(n):
    print(n)
    def next_sum(k):
        return print_sums(n + k)
    return next_sum
```

Useful to keep track of changing state (by updating the closure)!

Do Q4 + Q5!

# Q4

```py
def make_keeper_redux(n):
    """Returns a function. This function takes one parameter <cond>
    and prints out all integers 1..i..n where calling cond(i)
    returns True. The returned function returns another function
    with the exact same behavior.

    >>> def multiple_of_4(x):
    ...     return x % 4 == 0
    >>> def ends_with_1(x):
    ...     return x % 10 == 1
    >>> k = make_keeper_redux(11)(multiple_of_4)
    4
    8
    >>> k = k(ends_with_1)
    1
    11
    >>> k
    <function do_keep>
    """
    def do_keep(cond):
        i = 1
        while i <= n:
            if cond(i):
                print(i)
            i += 1
        return make_keeper_redux(n)
    return do_keep

# Q5

```py
def print_n(n):
    """
    >>> f = print_n(2)
    >>> f = f("hi")
    hi

    hello

    >>> g = print_n(1)
    >>> g("first")("second")("third")
    first

    def inner_print(x):
        if n <= 0:
            print("done")
        else:
            print(x)
        return print_n(n - 1)

Poll time! How are we feeling about Environment Diagrams? Code-writing?
