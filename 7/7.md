# Discussion 7

Today:
* Mutability
* Iterators
* Generators

Announcements:
* Ants project due next Friday!
  * Phase 1 due today
  * Phases 2+3 due 10/19
  * +1 EC if you turn in whole project on next Thurs
* Cats Contest due next Friday (optional)!

Miscellaneous:
* **Come grab a worksheet + Ferrero Rocher in the front.**
* Fill out my feedback form, even if it's (only) positive feedback (tell me what I should start/stop doing!)
* My office hours: Thurs 5-6pm, in-person.

Section Feedback:
* I got all your feedback, and it was quite positive! Thanks for helping me get a raise (haha jk -- we don't get raises :c). In all honesty, this section has been the most fun to teach that I've had (don't tell my past students :^))! Please continue using my feedback form above.
* The prevailing (negative) feedback was section is on the slow side, so I'll start going a bit faster! If you prefer the slower (original) pace, please let me know anonymously with the feedback form above :D.

# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Idea: You have *class*es, out of which you can create *instance*s (which we also call *object*s). This models real life, where we have some abstract model for objects (cars), and we have instances (my car -- haha just kidding I don't have one).

Variables: Two ways to associate data with classes
* **Class variable**: If the data is _shared_ among all instances (ie. a car has 4 wheels), then it should be a class variable
* **Instance variable**: If the data changes among each instance (ie. a car might be blue), then it should be an instance variable

Assignment:
* `self.my_var` is always to the *instance*!
* `my_car.my_var` is always to the *instance*!
* `Car.my_var` is always to the *class*!

Retrieval:
1. Instance Variable
2. Class variable

```py
class Car:
    wheels = 4 # Class variable
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = "blue"
```

Do Q1 and Q2!

# Q2

```py
class Button:
    def __init__(self, pos, key):
        self.pos = pos
        self.key = key
        self.times_pressed = 0

class Keyboard:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.buttons = {}
        for button in args:
            self.buttons[button.pos] = button

    def press(self, info):
        """Takes in a position of the button pressed, and
        returns that button's output."""
        if info in self.buttons.keys():
            b = self.buttons[info]
            b.times_pressed += 1
            return b.key
        return ''

    def typing(self, typing_input):
        """Takes in a list of positions of buttons pressed, and
        returns the total output."""
        accumulate = ''
        for pos in typing_input:
            accumulate+=self.press(pos)
        return accumulate
```

# Inheritance

Idea: You make a prototype, and then you build on top of that.

Anything with an `is a` relationship can be represented with inheritance (eg. A `Dog` `is a` `Pet`.)

```py
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.is_alive = True    # It's alive!!!
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner

    def eat(self, thing):
        print(self.name + " ate a " + str(thing) + "!")

    def talk(self):
        print(self.name)


class Dog(Pet):
    def talk(self):
        super().talk()
        print('This Dog says woof!')
```

Do Q3, 4

# Q3

```py
class Cat(Pet):

    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
        super().__init__(name, owner)
        self.lives = lives

    def talk(self):
        """Print out a cat's greeting.

        >>> Cat('Thomas', 'Tammy').talk()
        Thomas says meow!
        """
        print(self.name + ' says meow!')

    def lose_life(self):
        """Decrements a cat's life by 1. When lives reaches zero,
        is_alive becomes False. If this is called after lives has
        reached zero, print 'This cat has no more lives to lose.'
        """
        if self.lives > 0:
            self.lives -= 1
            if self.lives == 0:
                self.is_alive = False
        else:
            print("This cat has no more lives to lose.")
```

# Q4

```py
class NoisyCat(Cat): # Fill me in!
    """A Cat that repeats things twice."""
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
        # Is this method necessary? Why or why not?
        super().__init__(name, owner, lives)
        # No, this method is not necessary because NoisyCat already inherits Cat's __init__ method

    def talk(self):
        """Talks twice as much as a regular cat.
        >>> NoisyCat('Magic', 'James').talk()
        Magic says meow!
        Magic says meow!
        """
        super().talk()
        super().talk()
```

# Class Methods

Sometimes, you don't want `self`, you want the actual class `cls`. This is useful in things like factory methods, since Python doesn't have function overloading!

```py
class Dog(Pet):
    # With the previously defined methods not written out
    @classmethod
    def robo_factory(cls, owner):
        return cls("RoboDog", owner)
```

Do Q5.

# Q5

```py
import random as random

class Cat(Pet):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
        super().__init__(name, owner)
        self.lives = lives

    # Insert other previously defined methods here

    @classmethod
    def adopt_random_cat(cls, owner):
        """
        Returns a new instance of a Cat with the given owner,
        a randomly chosen name and a random number of lives.
        >>> randcat = Cat.adopt_random_cat("Ifeoma")
        >>> isinstance(randcat, Cat)
        True
        >>> randcat.owner
        'Ifeoma'
        """
        cat_name = random.choice(["felix", "bugs", "grumpy"])
        num_lives = random.randint(1, 20)
        return cls(cat_name, owner, num_lives)
```

# Str, Repr

Idea:
* `str` is human-readable. Typically, this will be some human interpretation of the object. (`"Sally the cat"`)
  * Obtained by using `str(obj)`, which implicitly calls `.__str__`
  * Used by `print`
  * Defaults to `__repr__` if not defined.
* `repr` is machine-readable. Typically, this will be something like the constructed form of the object. (`Cat("Sally")`)
  * Obtained by using `repr(obj)`, which implicitly calls `.__repr__`
  * Used by the REPL


```py
class Rational:

    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):
        self.numerator = numerator
        self.denominator = denominator

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.numerator}/{self.denominator}'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Rational({self.numerator},{self.denominator})'

>>> a = Rational(1, 2)
>>> str(a)
'1/2'
>>> repr(a)
'Rational(1,2)'
>>> print(a)
1/2
>>> a
Rational(1,2)
```
