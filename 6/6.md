# WWPD: Mutability

* Recall: Box analogy.
  * Changing something pointed to is considered _mutation_; changing the box itself is not!

Take care to commit these to memory:

| Method + Arguments     | Return Value | Functionality                                             |
| ---                    | ---          | ---                                                       |
| `lst.append(el)`       | `None`       | Adds `el` to end of `lst`                                 |
| `lst.extend(iterable)` | `None`       | Extends `lst` by concatenating `iterable` to end of `lst` |
| `lst.insert(i, el)`    | `None`       | Inserts `el` at index `i`.                                |
| `lst.remove(el)`       | `None`       | Removes first occurrence of `el` in `lst`.                |
| `lst.pop(i)`           | `el`         | Removes and returns element at index `i`.                 |

*Consider example* -- Python: If it *seems valid* and *non-ambiguous*, it *probably works*.

    for element in s:
        if element == x:

        count -= 1

# Iterators

Recall: Books (iterable) + bookmarks (iterator).

Some key things to remember:
* `iter(iterable) => iterator`
* `iter(iterator) => same iterator`! (iterators are themselves iterables!)

Common iterables:
* Lists
* `range(...)`

Do Q3.

# Generators

Now let's make our own iterators!

Syntax: make a function, but instead of `return`ing, we `yield` items. We call this a *generator function*. To make a *generator object*, simply call the generator function!

The generator function is not run when we call it! It simply returns the generator object, telling you that you can begin getting values from it. We call `next` on the generator object to get a value. Every time Python hits `yield`, it **immediately** stops execution and gives that value back. (Think of it as placing a bookmark in the function!)

```py
>>> def countdown(n):
...    print("Beginning countdown!")
...    while n >= 0:
...        yield n
...        n -= 1
...    print("Blastoff!")
>>> c1, c2 = countdown(2), countdown(2)
>>> c1 is iter(c1)  # a generator is an iterator
True
>>> c1 is c2
False
>>> next(c1)
Beginning countdown!
2
>>> next(c2)
Beginning countdown!
2
```

`yield from`: For the purposes of 61A, think of them as the equivalent of the following:

```py
>>> yield from my_iter
```

```py
>>> for item in my_iter:
...     yield item
```

```py
>>> def gen_list(lst):
...     yield from lst
...
>>> g = gen_list([1, 2])
>>> next(g)
1
>>> next(g)
2
>>> next(g)
StopIteration
```

# Generators: But Why?

Laziness vs Strictness.

Idea: Consider we want to look at all squares from 1 up to some unknown integer. We could do this:

```py
my_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, BIG_NUMBER)]
for square in my_squares:
    # Do something
```

We wouldn't want to make a huge list, since we'd only ever be looking at one element at a time. **Inefficient**.

New idea:

```py
def my_squares():
    i = 1
    while True:
      yield i
      i = i + 1

for square in my_squares():
    # Do something or break
```

**Constant memory usage, and also low initialization time!**

Just like how there are *list comprehensions*, we also have *generator comprehensions* (out of scope). We can rewrite the top as:

```py
my_squares = (x**2 for x in range(1, BIG_NUMBER))
for square in my_squares:
    # Do something
```

This is good if you know some upper bound you need to iterate to, but don't need everything all at once!

# Q4 Solution

```py
def filter_iter(iterable, fn):
    """
    >>> is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
    >>> list(filter_iter(range(5), is_even)) # a list of the values yielded from the call to filter_iter
    [0, 2, 4]
    >>> all_odd = (2*y-1 for y in range(5))
    >>> list(filter_iter(all_odd, is_even))
    []
    >>> naturals = (n for n in range(1, 100))
    >>> s = filter_iter(naturals, is_even)
    >>> next(s)
    2
    >>> next(s)
    4
    """
    for elem in iterable:
        if fn(elem):
            yield elem
```

# Q5 Solution

```py
def merge(a, b):
    """
    >>> def sequence(start, step):
    ...     while True:

    >>> result = merge(a, b) # 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15
    >>> [next(result) for _ in range(10)]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15]
    """
    first_a, first_b = next(a), next(b)
    while True:
        if first_a == first_b:
            yield first_a
            first_a, first_b = next(a), next(b)
        elif first_a < first_b:
            yield first_a
            first_a = next(a)
        else:
            yield first_b

# Do Q6.

After you finish, write another function such that primes are yielded in increasing order.

```py
def is_prime(n):
    """Returns True if n is a prime number and False otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(2)
    True
    >>> is_prime(16)
    False
    >>> is_prime(521)
    True
    """
    def helper(i):
        if i > (n ** 0.5): # Could replace with i == n
            return True
        elif n % i == 0:
            return False
        return helper(i + 1)
    return helper(2)

def primes_gen(n):
    """Generates primes in decreasing order.
    >>> pg = primes_gen(7)
    >>> list(pg)
    [7, 5, 3, 2]
    """
    if __________________________________:
        return
    if __________________________________:

# 2x: Interpreter Confusion

```py
>>> def my_func(lst = []):
...    lst.append(1)
...    return lst
>>> my_func()
?
>>> my_func()
?

# 2x: Interpreter Confusion

[1]

[1, 1]
```

Why? We will discuss in lab.

# 2x: Pairs

Write a generator function `pairs` that takes a list and yields all the possible pairs of elements from that list.

```py
def pairs(lst):
    """
    >>> type(pairs([3, 4, 5]))
    <class 'generator'>
    >>> for x, y in pairs([3, 4, 5]):
    ...     print(x, y)
    ...
    3 3
    3 4
    3 5
    4 3
    4 4
    4 5
    5 3
    5 4
    5 5
    """
    # YOUR SOLUTION HERE
