# Tree Recursion

A way of solving a big problem by breaking it down into (multiple) smaller subproblems **of the same nature**. (This means the *implementation* of the function is written *in terms of itself*.)

Example: `fibonacci`.

# Digression into Count_Partitions; Towards CS 170

Let's revisit the graph analogy made last week about breaking down problems.

# Q1: Count Stair Ways + Q2: Count K

Imagine that you want to go up a flight of stairs that has n steps, where n is a positive integer. You can either take 1 or 2 steps each time. In this question, you'll write a function `count_stair_ways` that solves this problem. Before you code your approach, consider these questions.

```py
def count_stair_ways(n):
    """Returns the number of ways to climb up a flight of
    n stairs, moving either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.
    >>> count_stair_ways(4)
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# Q1: Count Stair Ways

    >>> count_stair_ways(4)
    5
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    return count_stair_ways(n-1) + count_stair_ways(n-2)
```

---

# Q2: Count K

```py
def count_k(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 0
    else:
        total = 0
        i = 1
        while i <= k:
            total += count_k(n - i, k)
            i += 1
        return total
```

# Lists

* A list is a data structure that can store multiple elements. The elements do not need to be of the same type. Python lists are 0-indexed.
* Syntax: `[1, True, "hello"]`

Example:
```py
>>> lst = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
>>> lst[0]
6
>>> lst[3]
3
>>> lst[-1] # Same as lst[6]
0
```

---

# List Slicing

To take some indices out of a list, you can use the syntax `lst[<start index>:<end index>:<step size>]`. Note that the `start index` is **inclusive** and `end index` is **exclusive**.

```py
>>> lst[:3]   # Start index defaults to 0
[6, 5, 4]
>>> lst[3:]   # End index defaults to len(lst)
[3, 2, 1, 0]
>>> lst[::-1]   # Make a reversed copy of the entire list
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> lst[::2]  # Skip every other; step size defaults to 1 otherwise
[6, 4, 2, 0]
```

---

# Lists: Under the Hood

Environment Diagram:

```py
>>> nested_lists = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]
>>> a = nested_lists[1]
>>> a.append(4)
>>> nested_lists
?
```

Deep vs Shallow Copies:

```py
>>> nested_lists = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]
>>> my_copy = nested_lists[:] # Defaults to [0:len(nested_lists)]
>>> my_copy[1].append(4)
>>> nested_lists
?
```

---

# List comprehensions

List comprehensions are a compact and powerful way of creating new lists out of sequences.

Syntax:
```py
[<expression> for <element> in <sequence> if <conditional>]
```

Example:
```py
>>> [i**2 for i in [1, 2, 3, 4] if i % 2 == 0]
[4, 16]
```

# Q4: Even Weighted

Write a function that takes a list s and returns a new list that keeps only the even-indexed elements of s and multiplies them by their corresponding index.

```py
def even_weighted(s):
    """
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    >>> even_weighted(x)
    [0, 6, 20]
    """
    return [_________________________________________________]

```

---

# Q4: Even Weighted

Write a function that takes a list s and returns a new list that keeps only the even-indexed elements of s and multiplies them by their corresponding index.

```py
def even_weighted(s):
    """
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    >>> even_weighted(x)
    [0, 6, 20]
    """
    return [i * s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0]

```

# Q5: Max Product

Write a function that takes in a list and returns the maximum product that can be formed using nonconsecutive elements of the list. The input list will contain only numbers greater than or equal to 1.

```py
def max_product(s):
    """Return the maximum product that can be formed using
    non-consecutive elements of s.
    >>> max_product([10,3,1,9,2]) # 10 * 9
    90
    >>> max_product([5,10,5,10,5]) # 5 * 5 * 5
    125
    >>> max_product([])
    1
    """
    "YOUR SOLUTION HERE"
```

    125
    >>> max_product([])
    1
    """
    if s == []:
        return 1
    else:
        return max(max_product(s[1:]), s[0] * max_product(s[2:]))
```

# Bonus Question: Num Splits

Given a list of numbers `s` and a target difference `d`, write a function `num_splits`
that calculates how many
different ways are there to split `s` into two subsets, such that the
sum of the first is within `d` of the sum of the second. The number of
elements in each subset can differ.

You may assume that the elements in `s` are distinct and that `d` is always non-negative.

Note that the order of the elements within each subset does not matter, nor does
the order of the subsets themselves. For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3]`,
you should not count `[1, 2], [3]` and `[3], [1, 2]` as distinct splits.

> Hint: If the number you return is too large, you may be double-counting somewhere.
> If the result you return is off by some constant factor, it will likely be easiest
> to simply divide/subtract away that factor.

```py
def num_splits(s, d):
    """Return the number of ways in which s can be partitioned into two
    sublists that have sums within d of each other.

    >>> num_splits({1, 5, 4}, 0)  # splits to {1, 4} and {5}
    1
    >>> num_splits({6, 1, 3}, 1)  # no split possible
    0
    >>> num_splits({-2, 1, 3}, 2) # {-2, 3} {1} and {-2, 1, 3} {}
    2
    >>> num_splits({1, 4, 6, 8, 2, 9, 5}, 3)
    12

    Hint: You can split a set s into one arbitrary element and the rest with:

    k = s.pop()
    rest = set(s)
    s.add(k)

    After which s is unchanged, and {k}.union(rest) == s
    """
```

        if not s:
            return 1 if abs(n) <= d else 0
        k = s.pop()
        rest = set(s)
