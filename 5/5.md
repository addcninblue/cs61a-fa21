# Discussion 5

Today:
* Data Abstractions
* Trees
* Sequences

Announcements:
* Cats due today!
* Hog composition due today!

Miscellaneous:
* **Come grab a worksheet + Milanos in the front.**
* Fill out my feedback form, even if it's (only) positive feedback (tell me what I should start/stop doing!)
* My office hours: Thurs 5-6pm, in-person.

# Data Abstractions

* Core idea: abstracting complexity away through the use of common interfaces.
* Constructor/selector model.

Take this example:

```py
def user(user_id, user_name):
    return (user_id, user_name)

def user_id(user):
    return user[0]

def user_name(user):
    return user[1]
```

```py
addison = user(1, "Addison")
print(user_name(addison)) # prints Addison
```

Notice the above doesn't change even if we change the implementation of `user`!

---

# Tree Abstraction

A reminder:
* Node: Any item in the tree
* Label: The value associated with the node
* Branches: The direct descendents of the node

Go ahead and do Q1 + Q2!

Q2 challenge: Do it in one line.

---

# Q1: WWPD

Let's answer together

---

# Q2: Height

```
def height(t):
    """Return the height of a tree.

    >>> t = tree(3, [tree(5, [tree(1)]), tree(2)])
    >>> height(t)
    2
    """
    if is_leaf(t):
        return 0
    return 1 + max([height(branch) for branch in branches(t)])
```

---

# Q3 + Q4!

Continue thinking about this pattern:

```py
def function(t):
    if is_leaf(t):
        # base case?
    for b in branches(t):
        # recursive calls?
```

For Q4, think about the recursive leap of faith! (Recall: Assume all smaller subproblems have been implemented correctly with the recursive call, and construct your current call with the results of the previous calls.)

---

# Q3

```py
def max_path_sum(t):
    """Return the maximum path sum of the tree.

    >>> t = tree(1, [tree(5, [tree(1), tree(3)]), tree(10)])
    >>> max_path_sum(t)
    11
    """
    if is_leaf(t):
        return label(t)
    else:
        return label(t) + max([max_path_sum(b) for b in branches(t)])
```

---

# Q4

```py
def find_path(tree, x):
    """
    >>> t = tree(2, [tree(7, [tree(3), tree(6, [tree(5), tree(11)])] ), tree(15)])
    >>> find_path(t, 5)
    [2, 7, 6, 5]
    >>> find_path(t, 10)  # returns None
    """
    if label(tree) == x:
        return [label(tree)]
    for b in branches(tree):
        path = find_path(b, x)
        if path:
            return [label(tree)] + path
```

---

# Sequences

Map, filter, reduce

* `map` and `filter` are builtins
* `reduce` comes from `functools` (`from functools import reduce`)

All have function signatures of `f(func, iterable)`, and all return *iterables* (not lists!).

(Mental model: I'm applying `func` over `iterable`)

Python demo.

---

# Do Q5.

This tells you do implement your own versions that return lists instead of iterables! (Please don't just call the builtins.)

Which ones are doable in one line? Are there any that can't be done in one line?

---

# Map

```py
def my_map(fn, seq):
    """Applies fn onto each element in seq and returns a list.
    >>> my_map(lambda x: x*x, [1, 2, 3])
    [1, 4, 9]
    """
    result = []
    for elem in seq:
        result += [fn(elem)]
    return result
```

---

# Filter

```py
def my_filter(pred, seq):
    """Keeps elements in seq only if they satisfy pred.
    >>> my_filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # new list has only even-valued elements
    [2, 4]
    """
    result = []
    for elem in seq:
        if pred(elem):
            result += [elem]
    return result
```

---

# Reduce

```py
def my_reduce(combiner, seq):
    """Combines elements in seq using combiner.
    seq will have at least one element.
    >>> my_reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
    10
    >>> my_reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
    24
    >>> my_reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [4])
    4
    """
    total = seq[0]
    for elem in seq[1:]:
        total = combiner(total, elem)
    return total
```

---

# Poll! Q6, or Q7/8?

# Q6: Count Palindromes

```py
def count_palindromes(L):
    """The number of palindromic words in the sequence of strings
    L (ignoring case).

    >>> count_palindromes(("Acme", "Madam", "Pivot", "Pip"))
    2
    """
    return ______
```

# Q7: Perfectly Balanced (As All Things Should Be)

(Note: leaves are perfectly balanced!)

```py
def sum_tree(t):
    """
    Add all elements in a tree.
    >>> t = tree(4, [tree(2, [tree(3)]), tree(6)])
    >>> sum_tree(t)
    15
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

```py
def balanced(t):
    """
    Checks if each branch has same sum of all elements and
    if each branch is balanced.
    >>> t = tree(1, [tree(3), tree(1, [tree(2)]), tree(1, [tree(1), tree(1)])])
    >>> balanced(t)
    True
    >>> t = tree(t, [t, tree(1)])
    >>> balanced(t)
    False
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

# Q8: Hailstone Tree

```py
def hailstone_tree(n, h):
    """Generates a tree of hailstone numbers that will reach N, with height H.
    >>> print_tree(hailstone_tree(1, 0))
    1
    >>> print_tree(hailstone_tree(1, 4))
    1
        2
            4
                8

        16
            32
                64
            5
                10
    """
    if _________________________________:
        return _________________________________
    branches = _________________________________
    if ___________ and ___________ and ___________:
        branches += _________________________________
    return tree(n, branches)
```

# 2x!

Implement the following function using `reduce`, `map`, `filter`, `range`, and `lambda`:

```py
from functools import reduce

def repeat(f, x, n):
    """Apply f to x n times.  When n is 0, the result is x; when n is
    1, the result is f(x); when n is 2, f(f(x)), etc.

    >>> repeat(lambda x: x+1, 1, 5)
    6
    """
    ____
```

Also! Implement `map` and `filter` with `reduce`

# Towards Generators

* looping over them?
* `next()`
