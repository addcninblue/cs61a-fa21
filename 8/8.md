# Discussion 8

Today:
* Str/Repr review (again)
* Linked Lists
* Trees

Announcements:
* Ants project due today!
* Cats Contest due today!
* Midterm 10/27 (next Wednesday!)
  * Lab next week is midterm review, but do note it's the same day as the midterm.

Miscellaneous:
* **Come grab a worksheet + Biscotti in the front.**
* Fill out my feedback form, even if it's (only) positive feedback (tell me what I should start/stop doing!)
* My office hours: Thurs 5-6pm, in-person.

# Str, Repr

Idea:
* `str` is human-readable. Typically, this will be some human interpretation of the object. (`"Sally the cat"`)
  * Obtained by using `str(obj)`, which implicitly calls `.__str__`
  * Used by `print`
  * Defaults to `__repr__` if not defined.
* `repr` is machine-readable. Typically, this will be something like the constructed form of the object. (`Cat("Sally")`)
  * Obtained by using `repr(obj)`, which implicitly calls `.__repr__`
  * Used by the REPL


```py
class Rational:

    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator):
        self.numerator = numerator
        self.denominator = denominator

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.numerator}/{self.denominator}'

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Rational({self.numerator},{self.denominator})'

>>> a = Rational(1, 2)
>>> str(a)
'1/2'
>>> repr(a)
'Rational(1,2)'
>>> print(a)
1/2
>>> a
Rational(1,2)
```

Guide to what the REPL does when it sees

```py
>>> some_input
```

```py
if some_input is not None:
    print(repr(some_input))
```

Do we want to do WWPD?

# Linked Lists

Motivation: Sometimes, we care more about list operations that modify things in the middle more than we care about appending and deleting from the end. (Think about how expensive it is to pop an element from a list! You have to remove the element, then move all subsequent elements to their right place.)

As a result, we use Linked Lists!

| element | behavior |
| --- | --- |
| constructor | `lnk = Link(value, Link.empty OR Link(...))`
| get current value | `lnk.first` |
| get next value | `lnk.rest` |
| is Link exhausted? | `lnk is Link.empty` |

Represent using box and pointer diagrams!

We call `Link.empty` a _sentinel value_. (You don't need to know this for 61A)

Warmup: do Q2 + Q3. We'll go over this in just a few minutes.

---

# Q2. Let's do it together!

---

# Q3

```py
def sum_nums(s):
    """
    >>> a = Link(1, Link(6, Link(7)))
    >>> sum_nums(a)
    14
    """
    if s == Link.empty:
        return 0
    return s.first + sum_nums(s.rest)
```

---

# Do Q4 + Q5!

---

# Q4

```py
def multiply_lnks(lst_of_lnks):
    """
    >>> a = Link(2, Link(3, Link(5)))
    >>> b = Link(6, Link(4, Link(2)))
    >>> c = Link(4, Link(1, Link(0, Link(2))))
    >>> p = multiply_lnks([a, b, c])
    >>> p.first
    48
    >>> p.rest.first
    12
    >>> p.rest.rest.rest is Link.empty
    True
    """
    # Implementation Note: you might not need all lines in this skeleton code
    product = 1
    for lnk in lst_of_lnks:
        if lnk is Link.empty:
            return Link.empty
        product *= lnk.first
    lst_of_lnks_rests = [lnk.rest for lnk in lst_of_lnks]
    return Link(product, multiply_lnks(lst_of_lnks_rests))
```

This solution can be improved. How?

---

# Q5

```py
def flip_two(s):
    """
    >>> one_lnk = Link(1)
    >>> flip_two(one_lnk)
    >>> one_lnk
    Link(1)
    >>> lnk = Link(1, Link(2, Link(3, Link(4, Link(5)))))
    >>> flip_two(lnk)
    >>> lnk
    Link(2, Link(1, Link(4, Link(3, Link(5)))))
    """
    # Recursive solution:
    if s is Link.empty or s.rest is Link.empty:
        return
    s.first, s.rest.first = s.rest.first, s.first
    flip_two(s.rest.rest)

    # For an extra challenge, try writing out an iterative approach as well below!
    return # separating recursive and iterative implementations

    # Iterative approach
    while s is not Link.empty and s.rest is not Link.empty:
        s.first, s.rest.first = s.rest.first, s.first
        s = s.rest.rest
```

# Trees

You know trees. Now you will learn class Trees.

Comparison table:

| element | functional version | class version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constructor | `t = tree(value, branches = [])` | `t = Tree(value, branches=[])` |
| label | `label(t)` | `t.label` |
| branches | `branches(t)` | `t.branches` |
| is_leaf | `is_leaf(t)` | `t.is_leaf()` |

Do all the problems. You've done trees already, so this should be a review of `tree`s and new `Tree` syntax!

Remember `gen_ways_to_compute`? Well now it's back with a vengeance.

```

    combinations of outputs by placing parentheses at any valid location. Order

    >>> # (2*((3-4)*5)) = -10
    >>> # (((2*3)-4)*5) = 10
    >>> list(gen_ways_to_compute([2, 3, 4, 5], ["*", "-", "*"]))
