# Quick Scheme Review!

https://cs61a.org/articles/scheme-spec/

1. Primitives
    * Numbers (`0`)
    * Booleans (`#t`, `#f`) (Note that `#f` is the _only_ falsy value in Scheme!)
    * Symbols (`'hi`)
    * Strings (`"hi"`)
    * Do WWSD!
2. Call Expressions
    * `(<operator> <operand1> <operand2> ...)`
    * Same rules as Python call expressions!
    * Do WWSD!
3. Special Forms
    * They _look like_ call expressions, but have _different evaluation rules!_
    * Motivation: How can you write `if` statements as call expressions? (You can't!)
    * `define`:
        * `(define <name> <expression>)`
        * `(define (<name> [param] ...) <body> ...)` <=> `(define <name> (lambda ([param] ...) <body> ...))`
    * `if`: `(if <predicate> <consequent> [alternative])`
    * Do WWSD!

Side note: Why does this happen?
```scm
scm> nil
()
```

Reason: Scheme Interpreter tokenizes every valid token, then replaces each with equivalent internal representation. This is the same reason we have this in Python:

```py
>>> "hi"
'hi'
```

Do Q1!

# Pairs and Lists

**All lists are Linked Lists.**

Construction:
* `(cons 'a (cons 'b nil))`
* `(list 'a 'b)` (`list` is a function!)
* `'(a b)` <=> `(quote (a b))` (`quote` is a special form!)

Do Q2!

---

# Q2

```scm
(define with-list
    (list (list 'a 'b) 'c 'd (list 'e)))
```

```scm
(define with-quote
    '((a b) c d (e)))
```

```scm
(define helpful-list
   (cons 'a (cons 'b nil)))

(define another-helpful-list
    (cons 'c (cons 'd (cons (cons 'e nil) nil))))

(define with-cons
    (cons helpful-list anoather-helpful-list))
```

---

# Now do Q3+Q4!

--

# Q3

```scm
(define (list-concat a b)
    (if (null? a)
        b
        (cons (car a) (list-concat (cdr a) b))))
```

---

# Q4

```scm
(define (map-fn fn lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        nil
        (cons (fn (car lst)) (map-fn fn (cdr lst)))))
```

---

# Now we look at trees in scheme!

Idea:

* first element is the label
* rest of the elements are the branches

Ideas on how to implement this? (Q5?)

---

# Now we look at trees in scheme!

Idea:

* first element is the label <=> `car`
* rest of the elements are the branches <=> `cdr`

Do Tree Sum (Q6)!

---

# Q6

```scm
(define (tree-sum tree)
    (+ (label tree) (sum (map tree-sum (branches tree)))))

(define (sum lst)
    (if (null? lst) 0 (+ (car lst) (sum (cdr lst)))))
```

Key takeaway: elegantness!

---

# 2x

Write a function `pairs` that takes a list and returns a list wiht all possible pairs of elements from that list.

```scm
scm> (define lst '(3 4 5))
scm> (pairs lst)
((3 3) (3 4) (3 5) (4 3) (4 4) (4 5) (5 3) (5 4) (5 5))
```

Solution:

```scm
(define (flatten lst)
  (if (null? lst) nil
    (append (car lst) (flatten (cdr lst)))))

(define (pairs lst)
  (flatten
    (map (lambda (first-item)
           (map (lambda (second-item)
                  (list first-item second-item)) lst)) lst)))
```
